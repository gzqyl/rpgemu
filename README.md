# Notes
RPGEmu App is just an offline tool app which could let you play those games on your iOS devices, it does not supply any games.\
Though you could download thoese games from website with Safari browser, RPGEmu does not care about how you get the game files, it just give you the ability to play those games.\
It just likes my another emulator called "ROM Emulator", which could let you play GBA games on your iPhone or iPad.\
The difference is RPGEmu will let you play RPG Maker MV games.
